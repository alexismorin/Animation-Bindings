### Customizeable input system to puppeteer animation inside of Unity 

### About
This proposed animation system values and embraces the real time, human user interface driven nature of game engines and strives to use that to craft naturalistic, organic animation with unprecedented ease and speed. The director becomes a puppeteer, actively embodying every important, living creature and acted entity on set. They will sculpt a nuanced performance one pass at a time. 

While this idea is nothing new, we have a clear vision on how to make it easily understandable and accessible to artists and generalists based on years of animating quality film content with extremely tight budgets and technical/artistic teams as small as one person.

This tool is geared toward both 3D and 2.5D animation techniques where the game engine serves first and foremost as a powerful performance driven, animation tool.
